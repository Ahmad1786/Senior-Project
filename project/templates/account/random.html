<!-- 
    Eventually we can use this setup to extend Django Allauth templates
    I am calling it random.html for now but eventually this folder would be fiilled with html file(s) or templates...
    that share the same names as the django templates we want to customize 

    specifally this would be for the allauth/templates/account folder

    See https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/blob/main/docs/common/templates.rst
    or https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/common/templates.html for more details
