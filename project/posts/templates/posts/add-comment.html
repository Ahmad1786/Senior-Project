    Comment: {{ form.content }}
    <!-- These fields are "on" the html page but you can't see them. I need them included here or I get an
    invalid form error. I spent a long time trying to fix it but can't find a way. I even tried manually
    setting the values in the view but that wasn't working either.-->
